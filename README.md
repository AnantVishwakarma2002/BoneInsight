# 🦴 BoneInsight

**BoneInsight** is a deep learning project that detects and localizes musculoskeletal abnormalities from radiographs using the **MURA dataset**.  
It uses **DenseNet121** for classification and **Grad-CAM** for explainable visualization of affected regions.

## 🔍 Overview

BoneInsight classifies whether a patient’s radiograph shows any abnormality and highlights the affected region using Grad-CAM-based heatmaps.  
This project is part of ongoing medical AI research aimed at improving explainable diagnosis from X-rays.

## 🧰 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/BoneInsight.git](https://github.com/AnantVishwakarma2002/BoneInsight.git
cd BoneInsight

# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python pillow matplotlib

```

##🚀 Usage

Keep both GUI.py and mura_densenet121.pth in the same folder.

1. Run the GUI:
```bash
python GUI.py
```
2. Upload your radiograph through the interface.

3. The model will:

- Classify the image as Normal or Abnormal

- Generate a Grad-CAM heatmap to visualize the region of concern
